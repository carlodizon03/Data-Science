Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \\n\\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\\n\\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \\n\\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \\n\\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9605</th>\n      <td>MMu-_KRZhwM</td>\n      <td>18.01.01</td>\n      <td>Tips for a Fun New Year’s Eve</td>\n      <td>CollegeHumor</td>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>2017-12-30T17:03:47.000Z</td>\n      <td>Collegehumor|\"CH originals\"|\"comedy\"|\"sketch comedy\"|\"internet\"|\"humor\"|\"funny\"|\"sketch\"|\"holidays\"|\"new year’s eve\"|\"advice\"|\"lists\"|\"partying\"|\"awkward\"|\"being single\"|\"FML\"|\"cringeworthy\"|\"desperate\"|\"fails\"|\"well that’s disappointing\"|\"fomo\"|\"thirsty\"|\"siobhan thompson\"|\"CH Shorts\"|\"latest\"</td>\n      <td>555596</td>\n      <td>20430</td>\n      <td>1109</td>\n      <td>1456</td>\n      <td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MMu-_KRZhwM/default.jpg</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>It’s the best worst night of the year!\\n\\nSee more http://www.collegehumor.com\\nLIKE us on: http://www.facebook.com/collegehumor\\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.twitter.com/collegehumor\\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.collegehumor.tumblr.com\\n\\nCAST\\nSiobhan Thompson\\n\\nVanessa Jackson\\nTess Gattuso\\n\\nCREW\\nDirector - Marissa High\\nWriters - Jessica Clemons, Marissa High, Caroline Langella &amp; Esmeralda Pelayo\\nProducer - Jessica Clemons\\nProduction Coordinator - Esmeralda Pelayo \\nAssistant Director - Caroline Langella\\nDirector of Photography - Carissa Dorson\\n1st AC - Nicola Newton\\nGaffer - Maryn McGaw\\nSound Mixer - Lena Alkhatib\\nProduction Assistant - Kennya Rivera\\nGraphic Designer - Paula Searing\\nEditor - Brittany Joyner</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>14272</th>\n      <td>gTRRvvE3HiU</td>\n      <td>18.26.01</td>\n      <td>Helping Shane Dawson Get His Attitude Back (RIVERDALE Skit) | Madelaine Petsch</td>\n      <td>Madelaine Petsch</td>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>2018-01-24T21:06:57.000Z</td>\n      <td>madelaine|\"madelainepetsch\"|\"madelaine petsch\"|\"petsch\"|\"cheryl\"|\"blossom\"|\"cherylblossom\"|\"cheryl blossom\"|\"riverdale\"|\"shane dawson\"|\"parody\"|\"riverdale parody\"</td>\n      <td>311179</td>\n      <td>32449</td>\n      <td>242</td>\n      <td>1989</td>\n      <td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTRRvvE3HiU/default.jpg</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Something a little different today...

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\\n\\nJesus Christ Superstar Live - John Legend Rehearses (Promo)\\nhttps://youtu.be/-QR-TB_k20M\\n\\nNBC on YouTube\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>20108</th>\n      <td>sRbhD2unwBc</td>\n      <td>18.24.02</td>\n      <td>Rochdale vs. Tottenham Hotspur | 2017-18 FA Cup Highlights</td>\n      <td>FOX Soccer</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>2018-02-18T19:02:53.000Z</td>\n      <td>fox soccer|\"fa cup\"|\"fa\"|\"tottenham\"|\"rochdale\"|\"soccer\"|\"english\"|\"son\"|\"kane\"|\"erickson\"|\"dele alli\"|\"fox\"|\"fox sports\"|\"fs1\"|\"fox sports 1\"|\"fox sports soccer\"|\"sports\"|\"news\"|\"highlights\"|\"goals\"|\"2018\"|\"rochdale vs tottenham\"|\"fa cup highlights\"|\"rochdale 2 tottenham 2\"|\"football highlights\"|\"football\"|\"rochdale fc\"|\"rochdale tottenham 2 2 all goals\"|\"Rochdale and Tottenham Hotspur\"</td>\n      <td>55035</td>\n      <td>467</td>\n      <td>41</td>\n      <td>88</td>\n      <td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRbhD2unwBc/default.jpg</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Watch highlights between Rochdale and Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\\n\\n►Champions League Highlights 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERChampionsLeague\\n►Bundesliga Highlights &amp; Features 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERBundesliga\\n►The Best from Chicharito: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERChicharito\\n\\nAbout FOX Soccer:\\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Not everything wows like gravitational waves or spacefaring sportscars. That’s the case with the recent discovery of earliest stars in the universe. In a Nature paper published a few weeks ago, Judd Bowman and collaborators report a signal from the very first stars to form in our universe. The same result also hints at brand new physics that may help explain the nature of dark matter. This result flew under the radar in part because it’s a subtle and clever result that requires a bit of interpretation. Today we’re doing a Space Time Journal Club to explain this discovery. We’ll follow that with the solution to our recent trebuchet challenge question.\\n\\nWritten and Hosted by Matt O'Dowd\\nProduced by Rusty Ward\\nGraphics by Grayson Blackmon\\nAssistant Editing and Sound Design by Mike Petrow and Linda Huang\\nMade by Kornhaber Brown (www.kornhaberbrown.com)\\n\\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Big Bang, Quasar and Hypernova Supporters: \\n\\nBig Bang\\nCoolAsCats\\nDavid Nicklas\\nFaisal Saud\\nAnton Lifshits\\nJoey Redner\\n\\nQuasar\\nTambe Barsbay\\nMayank M.
